# Rustlings Exercises ðŸ¦€

Welcome to my repository for the [Rustlings](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings) exercises! This project contains my solutions and progress as I work through the small exercises designed to help me learn and practice Rust.

## About Rustlings

[Rustlings](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings) is a collection of small exercises that help you get accustomed to reading and writing Rust code. These exercises are a great way to practice and reinforce the concepts covered in the official [Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) and [Rust by Example](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/).

## Structure

Each folder in this repository corresponds to a different set of exercises focusing on various Rust concepts. You can follow along with my journey as I tackle each challenge, improving my Rust skills one step at a time.

## How to Use

Feel free to explore my solutions, provide feedback, or even fork this repository if you'd like to work on the exercises yourself. If you're interested in the original exercises, I highly recommend checking out the [Rustlings repository](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings).
